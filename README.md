## Privacy-Focused Alternative: Startpage üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

For more **privacy**, I prefer to use **Startpage** instead of Google. It uses Google's results while protecting my privacy by not storing personal info or search history. üîí

There are also other private search engines like **SearXNG** and **Brave Search** that you can access using **Tor**. However, keep in mind that you can't use Dorks on these platforms. üåê

The best approach is to use multiple search engines based on what you need and how much **privacy** you want to maintain. This way, you can balance the quality of search results with your privacy preferences! Happy searching! üöÄ
